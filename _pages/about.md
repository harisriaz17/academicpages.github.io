I am a final year student at the National University of Sciences & Technology (NUST). I'm currently trying to use transformer models for predicting English tokens from time series data. You can follow this work here. I've also worked as a machine learning intern at CERN. You can follow our work on using UNet for predicting fluctuations in space-charge distortion maps here. I am passionate about working at the intersections of AI-high energy physics & AI-HCI.
