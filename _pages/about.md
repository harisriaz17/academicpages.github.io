I am a final year student at the [National University of Sciences & Technology](https://nust.edu.pk/) (NUST). I'm currently trying to use transformer models for predicting English tokens from time series data. You can follow this work [here](https://github.com/harisriaz17/Transformers-for-In-Air-Handwriting-Recognition). I've also worked as a machine learning intern at [CERN](https://home.cern/). You can follow our work on using UNet for predicting fluctuations in space-charge distortion maps [here](https://github.com/harisriaz17/TPCwithDNN). Generally, I am passionate about working at the intersections of AI-high energy physics & AI-human computer interaction.
