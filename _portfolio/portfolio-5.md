This was a semester project for my "Advanced Programming" course. DeepFilter is an AI powered photo sharing web app built with ReactJS and ExpressJS. It allows users to apply fast style transfer and deep dream filters on their photos to share with other users and supports all the basic features of a typical social network. It can also be run on mobile devices using ngrok server. Specifically, it supports the following features:
* Login/sign up
* View user profiles
* Newsfeed
* Users can upload/share photos, like & comment on photos shared by others.
* Deepdream or Neural Style transfer filters can be applied on uploaded photos.
