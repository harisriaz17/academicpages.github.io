This is the source code for my bachelor thesis project - the goal is to use transformers e.g. XLNet to eventually recognize english tokens drawn in-air using sequential IMU data collected from a wearable Myo-armband sensor (to be worn by the user). If the sequence drawn in-air corresponds to a signature, we plan to use canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to compare the attention representations of different signatures.
